    <h2>
    Reading to relax
    </h2>

    We can be bombarded with advice about how to relax from many sources. Socials are full of tips and habits to adopt to enhance relaxation. Pressure to relax more can build to be an additional kind of stress.
    <br>
    But consider this - a book doesn't send you notifications. There is no slick video of an influencer encouraging you from within the paper pages of a good book. Reading to relax works both to keep you away from the screen and the pressures screens can bring. Neuroscientists tell us that our fraught brains also get a rest when we read. I'm not sure how relaxing it would be to be in a noisy scanner while trying to read but I am prepared to trust the scientists thought this one through in proper science style. 
    <br>
    Reading also works those parts of the brain we need to emphathise with others. To follow a plot, we need to know who knows what, how they feel about it and what each character believes others might be thinking. This skill to see inside the thoughts of fictional characters or real people is known as “theory of mind”. When people read about a character’s thoughts, areas of the brain associated with theory of mind are activated, meaning that practising those skills through reading fiction builds the skill set for real world applications. Better still, experimental studies have shown that people who often read fiction have better social cognition. In other words, they’re more skilled at working out what other people are thinking and feeling. Soft skills such as these have positive impacts in our social interactions. If reading about a character kicking a ball can activate the parts of the brain that are involved in actually kicking a ball, how much more beneficial is gaining insight into the life experiences of others through fiction?
