        title:      "I Capture The Castle",
        author:     "Dodie Smith",
        synopsis:   "Young love and family ties set against the backdrop of the English Countryside",
        review:     "I capture the castle by Dodie Smith is romantic and down-to-earth at the same time. Set between the wars it features a family living in genteel poverty in the English countryside. It's both a coming-of-age story and a tale about sisterhood. First love. First heartbreak. This is a well-written, humorous and engaging classic that will stay with you for years to come. I capture the castle will probably capture your heart too. It's been picked by readers and experts alike on top 100 lists. BBC Big Read of top 100 novels chosen by readers in 2003 and the BBC list from 2019 of the top 100 novels]. Joanna Trollope remarked “I know of few novels that inspire as much fierce lifelong affection in their readers”. It was written in 1949 when Dodie Smith was living in America and so has a feeling of nostalgia about the English countryside that still connects with readers in our more hectic times. Out of print in America for years, it enjoyed the rare privilege of being one of the most requested items of used bookdealers. Cassandra is the younger of the two sisters at the heart of this story and she is refreshingly bracing about the need for someone to marry into money to sort out the family's fortunes. When two rich and handsome American brothers move into the neighbouring Hall the stage is set for romance. Rose, the elder sister, is a classic English beauty but with a practical eye, aims for the heir Simon rather than younger brother Neil. Cassandra, (and perhaps this is needless to say), later falls for Simon and suffers from pangs of guilt at having feelings for her sister's intended. No plot spoilers here but readers may be able to see where the story is going…"

        title:      "Grown Ups", 
        author:     "Marian Keyes", 
        synopsis:   "A warm-hearted family saga set in contemporary Ireland.", 
        review:     "This is Marian Keyes' 14th novel and it's a cracker! It starts with a huge family birthday party. Jessie, Cara and Nell are married to the Casey brothers, Johnny, Ed and Liam. There are children from the current marriages and from earlier ones too. A big happy family. A party with all the trimmings. Then secrets are revealed and the façade cracks. The storytelling then loops back to reveal what led up to the birthday party. Relationships are seen in all their flaws and we follow the Casey families until the story arrives back where it started. Grown ups is full of signature Marian Keyes attributes. Her writing is easy to read and handles tricky subjects with a light but unflinching touch. Cara is bulimic and her fight to regain her health is depicted with empathy throughout. The Casey brothers have mean, critical parents and the wives all face relentless sniping from their in-laws. The description of the wedding anniversary from hell is very relatable and funny. Keyes has a great ear and her dialogue is witty and authentic. Her successful writing career has given her a worldwide following, with books translated into 32 languages and Grown ups went straight to No. 1 in the bestseller lists in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. This book will give you serious issues made relatable, characters who are recognizable and page-turning narrative all told with the writer's signature warm heart – recommended to all!"

        title:      "The Marriage Portrait", 
        author:     "Maggie O'Farrell", 
        synopsis:   "A young girl realises the danger her aristocratic husband presents to her life.", 
        review:     "Perhaps you loved the 2020's Book of the Year Hamnet? Maggie O'Farrell's 9th novel from 2022 has points of similarity with Hamnet, it's true. There's the vivid use of the present tense; for some the scenes in Hsmnet of brother and sister in the grip of the plague are too visceral, but for others this sense of immediacy of events is exactly the point. For The marriage portrait we leave Shakespearean England for Renaissance Italy, a world where the realpolitik makes pawns of women and children in the pursuit of family power. In a blend of historical fact and fiction O'Farrell creates the detailed back story from a previously marginal character. Though mentioned in Robert Browning's poem ‘My last Duchess', and her portrait painted by Agnolo Bronzino, Lucezia, third daughter of the ruler of Florence, Cosimo de Medici, is thinly drawn in historical records. A year and a half after her marriage Lucrezia is dead. O'Farrell does her thing and vividly re-creates her experiences to give us a sumptuously detailed central character. The book opens with Lucrezia being taken to a remote forbidding fortress by her husband. Suddenly, she becomes convinced that Alfonso is planning to poison her. The narrative loops round to her childhood full of beautiful writing that casts a spell over the reader, sparkling and rich with sensations but tensioned by cold-hearted politics behind the façade. The ending is perhaps the best bit of all – no spoilers but wow!"

        title:      "All The Pretty Horses", 
        author:     "Cormac McCarthy", 
        synopsis:   "A stripped-back cowboy odyssey across the Tex-Mex border.", 
        review:     "You probably know that American author Cormac McCarthy died earlier this year aged 89. He has long been a favourite writer so in recognition of his passing comes this recommendation for the first book in his Border Trilogy, All the pretty horses. Written on 1992, All the pretty horses is set in 1949 and the action takes place in Texas and Mexico. The central character is John Grady Cole, aged 16, who learning his ranch home is to be sold, sets out to make his way in the world with his friend Lacey Rawlings. They head to Mexico but meet up with Jimmy Blevins, a runaway riding a suspiciously fine horse. Blevins makes bad choices and leads the two Texan friends into danger. There are storms, beatings, and pursuit by the authorities. There is also first love and hard manual work on a ranch. Alejandra, daughter of the ranch owner catches John Grady's eye and falls for him in return but their love is star-crossed. John Grady and Lacey's involvement with Blevins comes back to catch them up in conflict with the Mexican authorities. Prison. Knife fights. Interrogations. Bevins is executed. It's looking bleak for the Texans. Prison ends abruptly as Alejandra's aunt buys their liberty. The cost though is that John Grady must abandon his love for Alejandra. He tries to win her over but she chooses to stay. Broken-hearted, he returns to Mexico. This is a rite of passage story set in a vanished world of cowboys and personal honour. John Grady has a quiet strength of character that is very appealing. More striking though than the story-telling is the way McCarthy's style of writing enhances the effect of the events of the book. His writing is sparse, with very limited punctuation, no speech marks for dialogue. This adds to the world of laconic ‘strong but silent' manly men. This is no space for sentimentalism in John Grady's Texas. It's tough and violent - and that's just the stylistic identity so typical of McCarthy's writing."

        title:      "Girl, Woman, Other", 
        author:     "Bernadine Evaristo", 
        synopsis:   "An expansive and life-affirming mix of 12 interconnecting stories that examine black womanhood in contemporary Britain.", 
        review:     "Remember the year two women won the Booker Prize? 2019 saw Bernadine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood share the honours. An unusual outcome but there's no doubting the star quality of Girl, woman, other by Evaristo. It's a winning combination of black characters who all experience being othered and othering; young, old, in between and with a range of genders and sexualities there's a lot going on in the lives of the 12 main characters. The intertwining of the narrative makes it easy to follow the different people as Evaristo lets us see into the viewpoints of each but retains links between them all. Amma, a black women playwright is the central figure, and all the characters gather to see her moment of recognition by the British establishment as her play, The last Amazon of Dahomey, is premiered at the National Theatre. It's a long way from her roots as a revolutionary critic of the wealthy white world of British theatre. Amma's daughter Jazz features as does Amma's best friend and co-founder of a radical black woman's theatre group, Dominique. Jazz loves her mother but is critical too, fearing her mother is a 'sell out' in the way of the 'woke' about those older feminists; she's embarrassed too by her mother's relationships. It's all quite relatable. Dominque's story shows us that political concerns don't always survive contact with real people. The view that 'only a black woman can ever truly loves a black woman' turns out to be emotional manipulation and the precursor to coercive control in her relationship. Evaristo uses a stream of consciousness style which seems to blur together the stories of the differing characters. The flow of this prose-poetry hybrid feels right, with the pace and layout of words matched to the lilt and intonation of the characters' voices. Her skill in storytelling is such that the reader feels they know the next character centred already, from the relationships with earlier characters, whether it be through family relationships or friendships or some less determined connection. There's a mix of age, of class and socioeconomic status, of education, of sexuality and gender. This wide cast allows Evaristo to show how intersectionality influences the lives of her characters, with some discovering they have more in common with a poor white person than a rich black person. Othering, marginalising and segregation creep in in subtle ways to frame the experiences depicted. This is not as well-known a world as is common in British writing but don't let the political conversations between the characters influence your view - Evaristo has written a complex, joyful, tough but immensely readable and relatable novel for everyone to enjoy. New perspectives from such a range of characters makes it a refreshing book."
